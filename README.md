# Password Generator

This project is a secure password generator application that creates strong, random passwords using a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. It leverages the secrets module for cryptographic security, ensuring that the generated passwords are unpredictable and secure. The application provides a user-friendly interface built with tkinter, allowing users to customize password length and character types.


## Features
- Secure Password Generation: Utilizes the secrets module for cryptographic randomness.
- Customizable Passwords: Users can specify the length and types of characters included.
- Clipboard Integration: Easily copy the generated password to the clipboard.
- Text-to-Speech Pronunciation: Hear the password pronounced for accuracy.
- QR Code Generation: Generate a QR code of the password for easy sharing and scanning.
- User-Friendly GUI: Intuitive interface built with tkinter for ease of use.


## Purpose
